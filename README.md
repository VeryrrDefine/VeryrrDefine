## Statement: Account Identity Clarification

Hello,

My username is VeryrrDefine, and I want to clarify that I am not an alternate account (alt) of **him that who sent a lot of "棍母"**. My account is entirely separate, and any claims suggesting otherwise are incorrect.

If there has been confusion due to similar activity, naming conventions, or any other reason, please note that this is coincidental. I do not control, operate, or have any affiliation with the aforementioned accounts.

Also, my friend help me visit Discord (because I cannot visit Discord), and I know someone created a channel which called *AD: PowiainaNum port*.

Thank you for understanding, and feel free to reach out if further clarification is needed.

— VeryrrDefine
